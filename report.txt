Diffuse and Specular illumination:
        I implemented the calculation of these in Scene.computeColour,
        I followed the Lambertian Diffuse and Phong Specular formulas
        as given in the lecture notes.
        I tested these by rendering the TestScenes and using ImageMagick's
        compare tool to compare my render to the samples provided. Namely
        the sphere and lighting scenes.

Shadows:
        I implemented shadows, by checking for an intersection with an
        object between the hit point and the light source. I tested this by
        comparing my output to the sample lighting scene. I noticed my shadows
        do not seem to be as big as those in the sample, I am unsure as to why.

Mirror reflections:
       I implemented mirror reflections by casting the reflected ray and
       computing the colour at that hit point, then adding it. I also tested
       this by comparing my output to the sample lighting scene, where I saw
       my reflections were identical.

Cones:
        I implemented these according to the equation for a cone x^2+y^2=z^2
        using the quadratic equation to solve it, and capping the z bounds.
        I again tested this by comparing my output to the provided sample for
        the cone scene, this is how I noticed initially my normals were wrong,
        and was able to correct them.

CSG:
        I believe I implemented these atleast somewhat correctly, as they match
        the sample output for the provided test scenes ie intersection,
        difference & union, aswell as for the scenes I have made and tested,
        but I am not completely confident my implementation is correct.

Other:
        I also implemented rendering of cubes, computing intersections with
        the planes, and checking the intersection points were in 'bounds'.

My sample scene description file and image are in the sample directory.
